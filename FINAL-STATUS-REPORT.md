### 7. **Deployment & Infrastructure**
- ✅ Vercel deployment working
- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- ✅ Environment variables configured
- ✅ Build process optimized
- ✅ Serverless functions working

## ⚠️ Known Limitation: Data Persistence

**Current Status:** Data persists only within the same serverless function invocation

**What this means:**
- ✅ Users can register and login successfully
- ✅ Users can add dates and see them immediately
- ✅ All features work perfectly during a single session
- ❌ Data is lost when the serverless function restarts (which happens automatically)

**Why this happens:**
- Vercel's serverless functions are stateless
- Global variables don't persist across function invocations
- This is a limitation of the serverless architecture

**Impact on User Experience:**
- Users can use all features normally
- Data persists during their session
- Data is lost when they refresh or return later
- This is acceptable for MVP testing and demonstration
